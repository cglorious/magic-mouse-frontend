### Attractions

#### MVP
[ x ] Button to component
[ x ] Count state to reducer
[ x ] access counter value that matches entity / connect to count value
[ x ] increment to change state
[ x ] decrement to change state
[ x ] render count

#### Stretch
[   ] As Coco, I want to log the count of attractions when moving to another page so I know how many rides I rode.
[   ] persist to the database

## TODO
- update addAttractionReducer
- render '/lands' onClick
