### Attractions
[   ] As Coco, I want to add a counter so I can track how many times I rode a ride.

#### MVP
[ x ] Button to component
[ x ] Count state to reducer
[ x ] access counter value that matches entity / connect to count value
[ x ] increment to change state
[ x ] decrement to change state
[   ] render count
[   ] maintain count when moving to another page

## Stretch
[   ] persist to the database

## Notes
- currently count is updating in redux
- must render the state
- How to maintain state when leaving the page?
- Do I need attractions components?
- Add seed data (at least 1 ride per land)
