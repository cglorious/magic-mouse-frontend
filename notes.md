### Attractions
[   ] As Coco, I want to add a counter so I can track how many times I rode a ride.

#### MVP
[ x ] Button to component
[ x ] Count state to reducer
[ x ] access counter value that matches entity / connect to count value
[ x ] increment to change state
[ x ] decrement to change state
[   ] render count

## Stretch
[   ] persist to the database
