### Attractions
[   ] As Coco, I want to add a counter so I can track how many times I rode a ride.

#### MVP
[ x ] Button to component
[ x ] Count state to reducer
[ x ] access counter value that matches entity / connect to count value
[ x ] increment to change state
[ x ] decrement to change state
[ x ] render count
[   ] maintain count when moving to another page
[   ] persist to the database

## TODO
- patch request
- dispatch state
- update reducer
- on form submit, re-render lands

## Notes
- persist information to database
- patchStarWars / StarWars Reducer

## Requirements
